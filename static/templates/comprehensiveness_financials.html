Table of Financial values
{% endblock %}


{% block heading_detail %}
	<p>Four aspects of financial reporting are tracked: the reporting of commitments and spend, the ability to track funds across activities and organisations, and the existence of activity budgets (which are also given added weight in the forward-looking component). Only <strong><em>current</em></strong> activities are assessed.</p>

	<p>This table shows the percentage of current activities where these financial elements are populated with valid data. (Values in parentheses indicate percentage of activities where elements are populated with any data.)</p>

	<p><strong>Key:</strong><br/>
        Dashes: Where a publisher has published to IATI in the past but whose portfolio contains no current activities.

{% block narrative_text %}
	<h5>Transaction - Commitment</h5>
	<p>The percentage of all current activities that contain at least one transaction of type "Commitment"</p>

	<h5>Transaction - Disbursement or Expenditure</h5>
	<p>The percentage of current activities with a start date more than one year ago that contain at least one transaction of type <code>Disbursement</code> or <code>Expenditure</code>. (NB activities less than one year old are excluded from the calculation as it is fair to assume that disbursements are not always made in the early stages of an activity's development)</p>


	<h5>Transaction - Traceability</h5>
	<p>The percentage of current activities containing a transaction of type <code>Incoming Funds</code> that also contain a transaction provider activity identifier. This links the funds disbursed by one organisation and received by another. (NB activities that do not contain incoming funds transactions are excluded from the calculation.) (In future the syntax of the provider-activity-id will also be validated.)</p>

	<h5>Budget</h5>
	<p>Percentage of all current activities that contain at least one valid budget entry. A valid budget entry must contain a valid <code>period-start</code> AND a valid <code>period-end</code> AND a valid <code>value</code> AND a valid <code>value-date</code>.</p>
{% endblock %}


{% block assessment_text %}
	<p>Only elements containing valid data are counted. Where applicable a total including invalid data is provided in parentheses.</p>
{% endblock %}


{% block exceptions_text %}
	<p>Only current activities are checked. A current activity is one with an activity status of implementing, a planned end date beyond today, or no end date. For disbursements and expenditure activities less than one year old (based on activity start date) are also excluded.</p>
